As such a compression application is not anywhere to be seen, we developed a compression application just for you!

Our application compresses and take video file using H.263 and H.261 Algorithm which make it smaller by size and still keeping the quality of the video. Method H.263 & H.261 utilize frame differencing using motion vector as prediction. Through processing in such codec, we are able to achieve more efficient Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and compact data file of video.

P.S :
This application in made to fulfill the assignment for Signal and Multimedia Processing as a developer from Electrical Engineering student in university of Indonesia.

## Requirements
Before running the app, run `pip install requirements.txt` in command prompt terminal to install all the requirement needed.

## How-To
- Go to the compress or take video section on left
- Choose directory as to where to save the result
- Input the video file by clicking on input or take video by webcam
- Save the compressed result
- There you have it mate! The compressed video
